# Arduino-serial-communication
Communication between two arduinos using only digital pins (now in fact betweet two arduinos with analog pins 5V and 3,3V)

It was working between digital pins, but now its in rebuild to work with anagol pins (5 and 3,3V), so its not working ;)
I will finish this, but there is no time :(
